## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- Contracts should be lightweight and focused on single responsibilities
- Traits should be composable and not create tight coupling
- Exception hierarchy should provide meaningful error context
- Stubs should generate idiomatic Laravel/MCP code

### Potential Issues
- Ensure interface contracts don't over-specify implementation details
- Watch for circular dependencies in trait usage
- Verify stub templates produce valid PHP code
- Handle potential namespace conflicts with application code

### Future Considerations
- Structure should support plugin architecture for custom transports
- Consider backwards compatibility for future structural changes
- Plan for additional utility classes in Support namespace
- Prepare for internationalization of error messages

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete directory structure matches specification exactly
- [ ] All contracts/interfaces defined and documented
- [ ] Foundational traits implemented and tested
- [ ] Exception hierarchy complete with proper inheritance
- [ ] Facade properly configured with Laravel service container
- [ ] Code generation stubs create valid, functional code
- [ ] Test structure supports comprehensive testing strategy
- [ ] All autoloading configured and functional
- [ ] Documentation covers all structural elements

- Integration testing of complete MCP communication

### Validation Summary:

**ACCEPTANCE JUSTIFIED:**

### Recommendations for Future Tickets:

1. **Next Priority**: Transport layer implementations (HttpTransport, StdioTransport)
2. **Follow-up**: Registry system concrete implementations  
3. **Integration**: Laravel-specific components (controllers, middleware, commands)
4. **Testing**: End-to-end MCP protocol testing once concrete implementations exist

### Conclusion:

This ticket has successfully achieved its foundational structure goals. All specified foundational components are implemented, tested, and working correctly. The architecture provides an excellent foundation for future MCP server functionality implementation. The foundational structure fully supports the package's intended MCP server capabilities while following Laravel conventions and best practices.

**TICKET STATUS: ACCEPTED** - All foundational structure requirements met with high quality implementation.
