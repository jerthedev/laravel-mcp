# Transport Layer Core Implementation

## Ticket Information
- **Ticket ID**: TRANSPORT-010
- **Feature Area**: Transport Layer Core
- **Related Spec**: [docs/Specs/06-TransportLayer.md](../Specs/06-TransportLayer.md)
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Small (1 day)
- **Dependencies**: 009-MCPSERVERHANDLERS

## Summary
Implement the core transport layer infrastructure including contracts, transport manager, and base transport functionality.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Implement transport contracts and interfaces
- [ ] Create transport manager for factory pattern
- [ ] Add base transport class with common functionality
- [ ] Implement transport discovery and registration
- [ ] Add transport lifecycle management

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Factory pattern for transport creation
- [ ] Abstract base class for common transport functionality
- [ ] Interface segregation for different transport types
- [ ] Error handling for transport operations

### Laravel Integration Requirements
- [ ] Laravel service container integration
- [ ] Configuration-driven transport selection
- [ ] Laravel logging integration

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify
- [ ] `src/Transport/Contracts/TransportInterface.php` - Core transport contract
- [ ] `src/Transport/Contracts/MessageHandlerInterface.php` - Message handling contract
- [ ] `src/Transport/TransportManager.php` - Transport factory/manager
- [ ] `src/Transport/BaseTransport.php` - Base transport implementation
- [ ] `src/LaravelMcpServiceProvider.php` - Register transport services

### Key Classes/Interfaces
- **Main Classes**: TransportManager, BaseTransport
- **Interfaces**: TransportInterface, MessageHandlerInterface
- **Traits**: Transport lifecycle traits if needed

### Configuration
- **Config Keys**: Transport selection and configuration
- **Environment Variables**: MCP_DEFAULT_TRANSPORT
- **Published Assets**: No additional assets

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Transport manager tests
- [ ] Base transport functionality tests
- [ ] Contract compliance tests
- [ ] Transport lifecycle tests

### Feature Tests
- [ ] Transport discovery and selection
- [ ] Manager factory pattern functionality

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Verify transport manager creates correct transport types
- [ ] Test transport lifecycle management
- [ ] Validate configuration-driven transport selection

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Transport contracts properly defined
- [ ] Transport manager implements factory pattern correctly
- [ ] Base transport provides common functionality
- [ ] Transport discovery working
- [ ] Lifecycle management functional
- [ ] Configuration integration working

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Core transport infrastructure implemented
- [ ] Transport manager functional
- [ ] Base transport class complete
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Ready for specific transport implementations
