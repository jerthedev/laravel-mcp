- **Feature Area**: Registration System Core
- **Related Spec**: [docs/Specs/08-RegistrationSystem.md](../Specs/08-RegistrationSystem.md)
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Small (1 day)
- **Dependencies**: 015-BASECLASSESTRAITS

## Summary
Implement the core registration system including the central registry, component discovery, and basic registration contracts.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Implement central McpRegistry for component management
- [ ] Create component discovery service for auto-registration
- [ ] Add registration contracts and interfaces
- [ ] Implement basic component storage and retrieval
- [ ] Add component validation during registration

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Registry pattern implementation
- [ ] Auto-discovery using reflection and file scanning
- [ ] Component validation and metadata extraction
- [ ] Thread-safe component storage

### Laravel Integration Requirements
- [ ] Laravel service container integration
- [ ] Laravel filesystem for component discovery
- [ ] Laravel caching for registration optimization
- [ ] Laravel configuration integration

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify
- [ ] `src/Registry/McpRegistry.php` - Central component registry
- [ ] `src/Registry/ComponentDiscovery.php` - Auto-discovery service
- [ ] `src/Registry/Contracts/RegistryInterface.php` - Registry contract
- [ ] `src/Registry/Contracts/DiscoveryInterface.php` - Discovery contract
- [ ] `src/LaravelMcpServiceProvider.php` - Register registry services

### Key Classes/Interfaces
- **Main Classes**: McpRegistry, ComponentDiscovery
- **Interfaces**: RegistryInterface, DiscoveryInterface
- **Traits**: Registry management traits if needed

### Configuration
- **Config Keys**: Discovery paths and registration settings
- **Environment Variables**: MCP_AUTO_DISCOVERY
- **Published Assets**: No additional assets

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Registry storage and retrieval tests
- [ ] Component discovery tests
- [ ] Registration validation tests
- [ ] Contract compliance tests

### Feature Tests
- [ ] Auto-discovery functionality
- [ ] End-to-end registration flow
- [ ] Integration with service provider

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Test component discovery in sample directories
- [ ] Verify registration works with different component types
- [ ] Test registry retrieval functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Central registry manages all component types
- [ ] Auto-discovery finds and registers components
- [ ] Component validation prevents invalid registrations
- [ ] Registry provides efficient component retrieval
- [ ] Integration with Laravel services working
- [ ] Caching improves discovery performance

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Core registration system implemented
- [ ] Auto-discovery functional
- [ ] Component validation working
