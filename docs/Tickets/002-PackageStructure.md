- [ ] `src/Registry/Contracts/RegistryInterface.php` - Registry contract
- [ ] `src/Registry/Contracts/DiscoveryInterface.php` - Discovery contract
- [ ] `src/Traits/HandlesMcpRequests.php` - Request handling trait
- [ ] `src/Traits/ValidatesParameters.php` - Parameter validation trait
- [ ] `src/Traits/ManagesCapabilities.php` - Capability management trait
- [ ] `src/Facades/Mcp.php` - Main MCP facade
- [ ] `src/Exceptions/McpException.php` - Base MCP exception
- [ ] `src/Exceptions/TransportException.php` - Transport exceptions

- [ ] `resources/stubs/resource.stub` - Resource class template
- [ ] `resources/stubs/prompt.stub` - Prompt class template
- [ ] `resources/stubs/mcp-routes.stub` - MCP routes template
- [ ] `resources/views/debug/mcp-info.blade.php` - Debug view
- [ ] `tests/TestCase.php` - Base test case
- [ ] `tests/Fixtures/` - Create fixture structure with sample components

### Key Classes/Interfaces
- **Main Classes**: 
  - OutputFormatter (console utilities)
  - Mcp (facade)
- **Interfaces**: 
  - TransportInterface, MessageHandlerInterface
  - JsonRpcHandlerInterface, ProtocolHandlerInterface
  - RegistryInterface, DiscoveryInterface
- **Traits**: 
  - HandlesMcpRequests, ValidatesParameters, ManagesCapabilities
- **Exceptions**: 
  - McpException (base), TransportException, ProtocolException, RegistrationException

### Configuration
- **Config Keys**: No additional config needed for structure
- **Environment Variables**: No additional ENV vars needed
- **Published Assets**: Stubs for code generation, debug views

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Contract/interface validation tests
- [ ] Trait functionality tests
- [ ] Exception hierarchy tests
- [ ] Facade functionality tests
- [ ] Console output formatter tests

### Feature Tests
- [ ] Directory structure validation tests
- [ ] Namespace autoloading tests
- [ ] Code generation stub tests
- [ ] View rendering tests (debug views)

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Verify all directories can be autoloaded
- [ ] Test that stubs generate valid code
- [ ] Verify namespace organization works correctly
- [ ] Test file naming conventions are consistent

## Documentation Updates

### Code Documentation
- [ ] PHPDoc for all interfaces with comprehensive examples
- [ ] Document all trait methods and usage patterns
- [ ] Exception class documentation with usage scenarios
- [ ] Facade documentation with method examples

### User Documentation
- [ ] Directory structure guide
- [ ] Namespace organization explanation
- [ ] Code generation guide using stubs
- [ ] File naming convention documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All directories from spec exist and are properly structured
- [ ] All contracts/interfaces are defined with proper PHPDoc
- [ ] All foundational traits are implemented
- [ ] Exception hierarchy is complete and consistent
- [ ] Facade is properly configured and functional
- [ ] All stubs generate valid, working code
- [ ] Test structure matches package structure
- [ ] Autoloading works for all namespaces
- [ ] File and class naming follows Laravel conventions
- [ ] Security considerations are implemented

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- Contracts should be lightweight and focused on single responsibilities
- Traits should be composable and not create tight coupling
- Exception hierarchy should provide meaningful error context
- Stubs should generate idiomatic Laravel/MCP code

### Potential Issues
- Ensure interface contracts don't over-specify implementation details
- Watch for circular dependencies in trait usage
- Verify stub templates produce valid PHP code
- Handle potential namespace conflicts with application code

### Future Considerations
- Structure should support plugin architecture for custom transports
- Consider backwards compatibility for future structural changes
- Plan for additional utility classes in Support namespace
- Prepare for internationalization of error messages

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete directory structure matches specification exactly
- [ ] All contracts/interfaces defined and documented
- [ ] Foundational traits implemented and tested
- [ ] Exception hierarchy complete with proper inheritance
- [ ] Facade properly configured with Laravel service container
- [ ] Code generation stubs create valid, functional code
- [ ] Test structure supports comprehensive testing strategy
- [ ] All autoloading configured and functional
- [ ] Documentation covers all structural elements
