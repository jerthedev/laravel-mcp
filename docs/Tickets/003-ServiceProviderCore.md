- **Dependencies**: 002-STRUCTURE

## Summary
Implement the core service provider functionality including service container bindings, interface registrations, and configuration management.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Implement singleton service bindings for core MCP services
- [ ] Set up interface to implementation bindings
- [ ] Add configuration merging and validation
- [ ] Implement dependency validation on boot
- [ ] Add environment detection capabilities

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] Interface binding with factory methods
- [ ] Configuration validation and error handling

### Laravel Integration Requirements
- [ ] Laravel service container integration
- [ ] Configuration system integration
- [ ] Environment-aware service registration

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify
